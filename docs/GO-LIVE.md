# Going live

What has to be true before the site is serving real news, and how to check each one.

## The three things it needs

| | What | Where it goes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A Postgres database | `DATABASE_URL` |
| 2 | The schema | `npm run db:setup` once |
| 3 | *(optional)* a newsapi.ai key | `NEWSAPI_API_KEY` — only for `NEWSGRAPH_PROVIDER=newsapi` |

Plus `NEWSGRAPH_CURSOR_SECRET`, which signs cursors. Rotating it invalidates every cursor already
issued, so treat it as long-lived.

## 1. Create the database

In the Vercel dashboard: **Storage → Create Database → Postgres**. Vercel injects `DATABASE_URL`
into the project automatically, for all environments.

This is standard Postgres and standard SQL, so nothing is locked in — but the Vercel integration
is the path of least setup, and it is the one this document assumes.

## 2. Apply the schema

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://…" npm run db:setup
```

Three tables (`news_articles`, `news_ingestion_status`, `news_worker_keys`) and one function
(`append_news_articles`). It is idempotent, so re-running is safe.

Verify:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c '\dt'      # or: select table_name from information_schema.tables where table_schema='public'
```

## 3. Set the environment

Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables (Production and Preview):

```
DATABASE_URL              (usually injected by the Storage integration)
NEWSAPI_API_KEY           your full-access key
NEWSGRAPH_CURSOR_SECRET   32 random bytes, hex
NEWSGRAPH_CRON_SECRET     optional; only for manual ingestion runs
```

## 4. Put the topics in

**This is the one file to edit:** `packages/contracts/src/seed.ts`.

```ts
{
  beat_id: "b_7c4e91f0a2d3",            // b_ + exactly 12 hex chars. Never reuse one.
  label: "Bitcoin",
  concept_uris: ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"],
  topic_filters: [],
  languages: ["eng"],
  excludes: "Price predictions and giveaway spam",
  state: "warm",
  refresh_interval_minutes: 15,
  freshness_slo_minutes: 30,
}
```

`npm test` checks every entry: the id format, that ids are unique, and that each concept URI is a
newsapi.ai-style Wikipedia URI. A malformed topic fails the build rather than failing in
production.

**`beat_id` is the key clients store cursors against.** Changing it for an existing topic silently
orphans every cursor already in the wild — so add, never renumber.

## 5. Run the first ingestion

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEWSGRAPH_CRON_SECRET" \
     https://newsgraph.vercel.app/api/cron/ingest
```

It returns one line per topic:

```json
{ "ok": true, "beats": 4, "inserted": 512,
  "results": [{ "label": "NVIDIA", "fetched": 50, "inserted": 47 }] }
```

The default provider is **Google News RSS**: free, key-less, English, last 24 hours, one request
per topic. The response says how many it made:

```json
{ "ok": true, "beats": 148, "calls": 30, "inserted": 497 }
```

Then check the topics:

```bash
curl https://newsgraph.vercel.app/api/v2/topics
```

A topic that ingested successfully reads `fresh` or `stale`; one that has never run reads
`unavailable`. If a topic reports `error` in the ingestion response, the message is the provider's
— usually a bad concept URI or a key without access.

## 6. The schedule

`vercel.json` runs `/api/cron/ingest` every 15 minutes. Vercel signs its own cron requests, so no
secret is needed for those; `NEWSGRAPH_CRON_SECRET` only guards manual runs.

> **Hobby plan crons run once per day.** A 15-minute cadence needs Pro. If you are on Hobby,
> either change the schedule in `vercel.json` or drive it from GitHub Actions instead.

## Checklist

- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` set, and `npm run db:setup` has been run against it
- [ ] `NEWSAPI_API_KEY` set
- [ ] `NEWSGRAPH_CURSOR_SECRET` set
- [ ] Topics added to `packages/contracts/src/seed.ts`, and `npm test` passes
- [ ] First ingestion returned `ok: true` with a non-zero `inserted`
- [ ] `/api/v2/topics` shows `fresh` or `stale` rather than `unavailable`
- [ ] The cron cadence matches the plan you are on
